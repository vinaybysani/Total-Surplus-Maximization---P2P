# Total-Surplus-Maximization---P2P


##Abstract
A fundamental component of e-commerce platform is ”Online Service Allocation (OSA)”, which matches service between producers and consumers. Existing systems focus on maximizing either of consumer utility or producer profit. We theorize, implement and test ”Total Surplus Maximization” [1] which embodies the idea of maximizing total surplus (sum of producer and consumer surplus) in Online Service Allocation. We intend to implement and test the
hypothesis for online peer-to-peer lending data set and project results accordingly.
